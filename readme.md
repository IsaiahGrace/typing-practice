# typing-practice
chose book txt file in current working directory and then load progress from progress file

# Windows
This python program uses ncurses to create a text user interface (TUI). To run on a Windows OS, I recomend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Then you'll need python, and ncurses.

# typing interface setup
* you don't have to press backspace when you type the wrong key
* you do have to press the right key to continue
* typed text apears in a different color
* the cursor is highlighted and highlights the current position
* errors are displayed after you type them

# which language to use?
 1. C, fast, and fun to program in. But verbose...
 2. C++, a little easier to manage data structures
 3. python, very easy to type, but not as fun...
 
ideally this program could run on my phone inside the termux environment...
